# API - Advanced

## Introduction

Hey there, welcome to the API - Advanced Project! We're diving into some cool advanced concepts related to APIs. By the end of this guide, we'll have a solid grip on how to navigate API documentation, tackle pagination, parse JSON results, make recursive API calls, and even sort a dictionary by value.

### Reading API Documentation

So, when we're dealing with APIs, the first thing we do is thoroughly read the documentation. It's like our roadmap, showing us all the endpoints, request methods, required parameters, and response formats. Let's make sure we understand it because it's our key to effective API integration.

Example:
```python
# Using requests library to get information from an API endpoint
import requests

url = 'https://api.example.com/users'
response = requests.get(url)

# Check the status code and parse the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print(data)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
```

### Using an API with Pagination

Alright, APIs often throw pagination at us to limit the data in a single request. No worries, we got this! We just need to understand those pagination parameters and make subsequent requests to get more data.

Example:
```python
# Paginating through API results
page = 1
while True:
    url = f'https://api.example.com/users?page={page}'
    response = requests.get(url)

    if not response.json():
        break  # No more data

    # Process the data
    process_data(response.json())

    page += 1
```

### Parsing JSON Results

Now, when we're dealing with data, it's usually in JSON format. We just use the `json` module in Python to make sense of it and turn it into something we can work with.

Example:
```python
import json

# Parsing JSON results
api_response = '{"name": "John", "age": 25}'
data = json.loads(api_response)

print(data['name'])  # Output: John
```

### Making Recursive API Calls

Sometimes, data is all nested or paginated, and we need to make recursive API calls. Not a problem! We just need to set up proper termination conditions to avoid going in circles.

Example:
```python
# Making recursive API calls
def fetch_data(page=1):
    url = f'https://api.example.com/data?page={page}'
    response = requests.get(url)

    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        process_data(data)

        if data.get('has_next_page'):
            fetch_data(page + 1)
```

### Sorting a Dictionary by Value

Lastly, when we have a dictionary and want to sort it by values, we use the `sorted` function with a custom sorting key. Easy peasy!

Example:
```python
# Sorting a dictionary by value
my_dict = {'a': 3, 'b': 1, 'c': 2}
sorted_dict = dict(sorted(my_dict.items(), key=lambda x: x[1]))

print(sorted_dict)  # Output: {'b': 1, 'c': 2, 'a': 3}
```

## Conclusion

Well done! We've wrapped up our API - Advanced Learning Project. We now have these awesome skills to navigate API docs, handle pagination, parse JSON, make recursive calls, and sort dictionaries. Let's go out there and apply this in real-world scenarios, leveling up our full-stack developer game.

Happy coding, friend!
