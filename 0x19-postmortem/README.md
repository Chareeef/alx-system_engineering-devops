**Issue Summary:**
From 7:15 PM to 8:22 PM (GMT+00), our database went on a coffee break, disrupting transfusion centers' stats updates. Approximately 30% of users, mainly the data enthusiasts, faced a temporary blackout.

**Root Cause:**
The culprit? A breakup without closure – the absence of cascade handling during a transfusion center record's deletion caused relational chaos.

**Timeline:**
- *Issue Detected:* At 7:15 PM, Datadog sent a distress signal via PageDuty, alerting us to the database's sudden hiatus.
- *Actions Taken:* Initially accused the network, but turns out it was an internal affair – delved into database and web server connections.
- *Misleading Paths:* Went on a wild goose chase exploring network configurations and imagined DDoS attacks, realizing we were barking up the wrong tree.
- *Escalation:* Called in the database gurus at 7:45 PM when the network was declared innocent.
- *Resolution:* Played matchmaker by implementing cascade handling, and the database was back in the game by 8:22 PM.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
- *Cause:* The database had commitment issues – no cascade handling during a record's deletion led to emotional turmoil across services.
- *Resolution:* Became the relationship therapist, introducing cascade handling to ensure breakups are clean and drama-free.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
- *Improvements:*
  - Strengthen monitoring with a focus on detecting anomalies related to database operations.
  - Conduct a comprehensive review of critical database operations to identify potential cascade issues systematically.
- *Tasks:*
  - Establish a rigorous testing protocol for all database changes, emphasizing the identification and mitigation of cascade effects.
  - Update documentation with clear guidelines on proper cascade handling for developers.
  - Schedule a team training session to enhance awareness of recognizing and addressing database anomalies promptly.
