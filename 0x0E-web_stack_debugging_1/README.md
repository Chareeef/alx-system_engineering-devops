# Web Stack Debugging Summary

Debugging in software engineering is a challenging yet essential aspect that requires time, experience, and a systematic approach to resolve issues within a web application's technology stack. This guide aims to provide insights and methods to effectively debug and resolve common issues encountered in web development.

## Non-Exhaustive Guide to Debugging

### Simulate Environment
- **Checker or Testing Environment:** For issues with Bash scripts or code, simulate the flow using Docker containers with specific distributions as specified in the requirements.

### Test Assumptions
- **Debugging Web Servers:** Example questions to ask:
  - Check if the web server is started.
  - Verify the port it should listen on.
  - Ensure it's actually listening on the correct port and IP.
  - Check for enabled firewalls and logs for insights.
  - Test connectivity to the HTTP port using tools like `curl`.

### Machine State Overview
- **Quick Commands on Server Connect:** 
  - `w`: Shows server uptime and user connections.
  - `history`: Displays previously run commands for debugging insights.
  - `top`: Reveals current resource-intensive processes.
  - `df`: Illustrates disk utilization.
  - `netstat`: Displays port and IP information.

### Machine-Level Debugging
- **Server Health Check:**
  - Verify disk space, CPU load, available memory, and disk IO.
  - Address resource deficiencies by freeing up, increasing resources, or distributing usage.

### Network Issues
- **Check Network Configuration:** Ensure expected network interfaces, listening sockets, and firewall rules are correctly set.
- **Test Connectivity:** Verify connections using `ifconfig`, `netstat`, and `telnet` for connections to specific IPs and ports.

### Process-Level Debugging
- **Software Behavior Analysis:** 
  - Check if software services are started and their processes are running.
  - Dive into logs for valuable information about the software's behavior.

### Conclusion
Debugging is both challenging and rewarding. Experience and methodical approaches help in becoming proficient. As bugs are an inherent part of software development, gaining expertise in debugging will lead to tackling more complex and rewarding challenges in the field.

Remember, bugs never vanish; they evolve, presenting opportunities to learn and grow as a skilled developer. Embrace the journey!

Debugging might be tough, but the more challenging the bug, the sweeter the victory when it's fixed! Good luck on your debugging adventures!
